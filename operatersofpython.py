# # #ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
# # # Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
# a=10
# b=5
# sum=a+b
# diff=a-b
# mul=a*b
# div=a/b
# mod=a%b
# exp=a**b

# print("sum:",sum)
# print("diff:",diff)
# print("mul:",mul)
# print("div:",div)
# print("remainder:",mod)
# print("exponent:",exp)

# # #relational operators
# # # Relational operators are used to compare two values and return a boolean result (True or False).
# a=10
# b=5 
# print(a==b)
# print(a!=b)
# print(a>b)
# print(a<b)
# print(a>=b)
# print(a<=b)

# #Assignment operators
# # Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. They can also perform arithmetic operations and assign the result to a variable.
# a=10
# a+=5 
# print(a)
# a-=4
# print(a)
# a*=100
# print(a)
# a/=2
# print(a)
# a%=3
# print(a)

#logical operators
# Logical operators are used to combine multiple boolean expressions and return a single boolean result.

print(not False) #ans should be True
print(not True) #ans should be False
